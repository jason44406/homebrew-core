## 2020-04-13 -- Jason
## This is from an older commit of openssl.  Since then, 1.1.0 has become the standard, and 1.0.1 has been removed.  This is all fine and dandy, but many of our libraries need the older version.  If brew decides to update and wipe out the 1.0.1 version, then just install from here:
## `brew install Formula/openssl.rb`
## Openssl may need to be uninstalled first: `brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies openssl`

# This formula tracks 1.0.2 branch of OpenSSL, not the 1.1.0 branch. Due to
# significant breaking API changes in 1.1.0 other formulae will be migrated
# across slowly, so core will ship `openssl` & `openssl@1.1` for foreseeable.
